Analysis Tools
==============

This page provides an overview of the Python tools available for analyzing Solar Orbiter data.

Core Libraries
--------------

The following open-source Python libraries are useful for working with Solar Orbiter data:

- `sunpy <https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/>`_: General-purpose solar data analysis (maps, time-series, coordinate transformations).
- `sunpy_soar <https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/soar/en/latest/>`_: General-purpose solar data analysis (maps, time-series, coordinate transformations).

Other python packages
----------------------

- `stixpy <https://stixpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ : Python package utilising SunPy ecosystem for analysing data from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) instrument onboard Solar Orbiter.
- `sunraster <https://github.com/sunpy/sunraster>`_ : SunPy-affiliated package which provides tools to analyze data from spectral data from any solar mission - including SPICE onboard Solar Orbiter
- `sospice <https://github.com/solo-spice/sospice>`_ : Python data analysis tools for the SPICE extreme-UV spectrometer on Solar Orbiter
- `solo-epd-loader <https://github.com/jgieseler/solo-epd-loader>`_ : Data loader (and downloader) for Solar Orbiter/EPD energetic charged particle sensors EPT, HET, and STEP.




Community Resources
-------------------

Solar Orbiter provides several community tools and resources to facilitate data analysis:
